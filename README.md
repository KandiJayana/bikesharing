# Bikesharing: Using tableau 

## Overview of the analysis:

Before we started the analysis we needed to make a change in the csv original file to change the column that records the trip duration in seconds to hours, minutes and seconds. Then I uploaded the new CSV into tableau with the converted tripduration column to start make our visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results:
- The largest amount of people is male and subscribers:

- A large number of people have a low average time for trip duration:

- Male and Subscribers are still the largest group who usually rides on Thursdays afternoon:

## Summary: 

The results from all visualizations in tableau showed us that Thursday is the most popular day to take a bike ride. Another patter that shows is the time of the day, which is most busy in the morning or afternoons. Also, female gender is showing their peak on Saturdays. So I would reccomend the customer that  start the bikeshare to invest in specific groups for thoses who are using bike to get to work or those who want to have fun on weekends. My concer is whenever the weater gets colder, so I would suggest to the custumer to create visualizations from data in beetween November to March. First: Number of trips x  hour of the day. Second: Usertype x gender.
